In this fast-paced FPS, two teams compete for control of Strike Points on the futuristic and dystopian battlefield - Sector 9. Navigate the cityscape, control the rooftops, take down snipers, and fight your way through hails of gunfire and grenades. Earn experience and level up to unlock passive abilities. Use in-game cash rewards to unlock weapon choices. And watch out for the trolley!
