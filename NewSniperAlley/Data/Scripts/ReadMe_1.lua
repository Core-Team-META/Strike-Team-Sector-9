    #Information:
        Adding state Machine:
            A new state machine starts with the State_StateBase.
                For a new state you would require the StateBase and set metatable of statebase to new state.
                So the start of a new State would looks like this. 

                    local StateBase = require(script:GetCustomProperty("StatesStateBase"))

                    local NewState = {}
                    NewState.__index = NewState
                    setmetatable(NewState, StateBase)
                    NewState.FinishTask = nil
                    NewState.name = "Dance" 
                    NewState.possibleStates = {
                        "Idle",
                        "End",
                        "Walk"
                    }
                
                So the possible states are the Idle, End, Walk. these are the names of the State,
                
                You will then override what is in the Statebase depending on what you want to do. For example:
                    
                    function NewState:Enter(player, time)
                        if not Object.IsValid(player) then return end 
                        StateBase.Enter(self) -- this line calls the Statebase also with overriding it 

                        --- thing you want to do 
                    end
                
                Will override the base so when that state is called it does this action instead.

            Next After making several states you would want to make a place to store the states.
                States_MovementStates is the Movement system uses. All it does is return the custom properties that were added.
                Cloning this script to use as a state storage will work. And to add states just add the state as a custom property.
            
            Finally would be the State Manager
                One is already made called stateManager.
                Create a new script that requires state manager and State holder.
            
                When a player or other object joins just do local NewManager = statemanager.New(player,StateHoler, Default state)
                When swapping just call the statemanager on the player with NewManager:ChangeState(NewManager:GetDefaultState():GetName())

                For more information view States_StatesPlayerSetUp.lua script.

        Adding Weapons and equipment:
            Adding weapons/equipment and skins to the equipment handler. 
            Adding Weapons:
                Weapon template is the basis for data storage of equipment and on there you will find:
                    script - ignore
                    Weapon - The item that will be equipped to the player.
                    DefaultSkin -  The Skin that will be the default when equipping the player if no other skin is found. Please see adding skins.

                    Hoister - Where on the body is the item placed if not equipped.
                    RotationOffset - Used to align Equipment rotation.
                    Scale - Scales the Equipment in the renderer.
                    Level - makes it so the Equipment cannot be used unless the level is reached

                    Cost - Cost of Equipment.
                    Icon - Unused. Icon for the weapon.
                The weapons are modifided versions of the default weapons but the default will work also. 
                The only real difference that will need to take note of is that the weapons art will need to be seperated and used as a skin.
                You will need to Add the custom properties that are strings.
                    SprintStance - Animation stance
                    WeaponType - name of weapon (used for achievements)
            
            Adding skins:
                Skins are empty geometry with scoping scripts on them. And the scopes Geo. 
                Skin Template is for storing the data in the handler:
                    Skin - The skin object.
                    Level - Locks the skin to a level.
                    ID - The skins independent id. Note this can match with other skin id as long as the other skin is on a different weapon. *Note: Has to be 2 char long
                    Rarity - The skin rarity that will show in the loadout it will affect the cost. 
                    EventSkin - A booleon that will hide the skin in the loadout if the player doesn't have it. Used for events. 

        Adding Gamemodes:
            *note this system is still under development so somethings may behave weirdly and some things may be misplaced.
            To Add a gamemode to the system add a folder under Game Mode System. It would be easier to copy an existing one.
            Each folder contains:
                    ENABLED - Is gameMode enabled
                    SHOULD_RESPAWN - Can players respawn
                    ID - Game Id for Voting
                    SCORE_LIMIT - Game Score Limit
                    OBJECTIVE_POINTS - How many objective points are earned per action

            Most gamemodes require the basics of GAMEMODE_Server.lua local functions/Requires and custom properties. 
            Only thing that needs to be modified is the Global functions to perform new actions.

        Adding Achievements:
            Setting up an Achievemnt:
                Add ACHIEVEMENT_Data_Example as a child of the Achievemnts folder with the others.

                    To Add Rewards to the achievement 
                    there are 2 types of achievements:
                        ACHIEVEMENT_Data_RESOURCE_REWARD_Example
                            Enabled - Enables the achievement
                            WeaponId - ID of the weapon you want to reward
                            SkinId = ID of the Skin you want to reward

                When the count for the Required is reached the Achievement will be rewarded.


        Adding to the killfeed:
            To add a weapon to the kill feed is under feed icons add another IconModule. 
            
            Icon module contains:

            if after adding the weapon to the killfeed and not showing it could be that the projectile damage is not assigning
            damagesource to an abilty that is a child of the weapon template.

    #Publishing:
        There are several steps needed to be taken to publish the game.
            You will need to create storage keys.
            See the StorageKeys file in the hierarcy which is where those keys are stored (there are 5)
            The link for the published game should be in the MainGameId.
            The link for the Loadout game should be in the LoadoutGameId.
            The Game Portal Settings will need to have links to the screenshots game and the Screenshot Index set to the image you'd like
            In order to do this, it is easiest to 
                1) publish the screenshot game and save the link from that.
                2) publish the loadout game and save the link from that.
                3) publish the main game, after setting the keys and the Ids in StorageKeys, and setting up the 3 Game Portal settings
                4) publish the loadout game again, but now updating with the links for the main game and the loadout.
