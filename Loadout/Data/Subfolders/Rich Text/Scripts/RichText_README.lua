Hi!

This is my rich text library.  It's for making
nice, formatted text appear on the screen in Core.

Making it work is really simple:

1. Make a UIPanel item in your game UI somewhere.

2. Include the Rich Text Manager (_RichTextMgr) library
   in a script file, via require().

3. Call the rich text function DisplayText(), with the
   text you want to display, with markup!

See the RichText_Example for a demonstration of this!
